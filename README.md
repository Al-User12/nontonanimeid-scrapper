# nontonanimeid scrapper

Welcome to Anime Update Scrapper! This project is designed to [briefly describe what your project does]. Whether you're looking to contribute or just run it locally, here's all you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Bun](https://bun.sh/). This project uses Bun as its JavaScript runtime and package manager.
- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine. This guide assumes you are familiar with the terminal/bash command line.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```sh
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [project directory]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   This project relies on several dependencies, which can be installed using Bun. Run the following command in the project root directory:

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

   This command installs all the necessary dependencies defined in `bun.json`. It ensures that you have all the required packages to run the project successfully.

## Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you're ready to run the project. Here's how:

1. **Start the development server**

   Use the following command to start the development server:

   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

   This command executes the `dev` script defined in `bun.json`, which typically starts a local development server.

2. **Access the application**

   Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   This URL points to the local server instance of your project. You should now be able to see the project running and interact with it.
